		// And, finally update the lease timer
		update_lease_time_display(remaining_lease);

		// MATH!
		//
		// The trick to the crazy 14697 number is finding a fraction very close to
		// 1/(bus clk * 24), but the denominator is a power of two and the
		// numerator is as close to an integer as possible. The maximum number that
		// can multiply the maximum 48-bit number and stay within 64-bits is 2^16
		// (64 - 48 = 16), or 65535. Note that I'm using 1/(99750000 * 24) as a
		// baseline, as I assume 99.75MHz is the target bus frequency.
		//
		// The upper bound for the denominator is 2^47 given those constraints, as
		// (2^47) * 1/(99750000 * 24) is the biggest number under 65535 we can get
		// without exceeding 65535. So the next step is to multiply 1/(bus clk * 24)
		// by every power of two that keeps the result >= 1, and use the numerator
		// that is closest to an integer to minimize error. For mine, this is 2^45,
		// which has a numerator of 14697.04... It's the closest numerator to an
		// integer of all the options, so it'll be the most accurate. For bus clocks
		// very close to 99.75MHz, 14697 is still the best number for this.
		//
		// Now what GCC does here is really neat: it multiplies the upper 32 bits of
		// 'difference' by the numerator, and then 32-bit x 32-bit --> 64-bit
		// multiplies the numerator by the lower 32 bits. Then, it adds the result
		// of the upper 32-bit multiply with the upper 32-bits of the 64-bit result
		// from the lower 32-bits multiply. Then it shifts that sum right by 13
		// instead of 45, and uses that register. This is one of my favorite tricks,
		// and I'm glad to see GCC doing it here. :)
		//
		// Note:
		// Finding error: first find the actual number of seconds the machine will
		// count to. In my case it's 117576. (2^48 - 1)/COUNTER_VALUE_PER_SEC = max
		// seconds, where for me COUNTER_VALUE_PER_SEC = 2393976245. Then,
		// ((14697/2^45)*2393976245)*117576 = max displayed seconds. For me, max
		// displayed seconds is 117575. That's one second lost per the entire
		// countable range in CPU/bus ratio mode, which is about 1 day, 8 hours, and
		// 40 minutes! In my actual calculation I kept as many decimal places as
		// possible, but they've been omitted here for clarity.
		//
		// The internal timer will not have any slowdown, as there is no approximate
		// division being done anywhere except for displaying the countdown on-
		// screen. Floats would solve this, but this is MUCH faster. I mean, just
		// compare it to the doubles shenanigans necessary to divide by 200MHz!
		// (Unfortunately there's no good approximation for 200MHz. The best I
		// found, 43/2^33, loses 0.8 seconds every 10 minutes.)
