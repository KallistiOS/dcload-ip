WHATS NEW IN 1.0.4

* Maintenance versions of dcload moved into the CA CVS repository on
  SourceForge with the blessings of adk. Please send future bug reports and
  patches to bard@allusion.net. If there is sufficient demand, we'll setup
  a separate mailing list for it, but you can also join the KOS mailing
  list for dcload questions.
* Fix for a bug that makes the last 1024 bytes of an uploaded file sometimes
  come out as garbage [Jason Fritcher/Jim Ursetto]
* Hack to avoid some segfaults in dc-tool [adk]
* Use configured LD, not sh-elf-ld in 1st_read [adk]
* Integrated Lan Adapter support [Dan Potter]
* Broadband Adapter driver improvements [dp]
* Colorized backgrounds for status (green, red) [dp]
* Moved text display down and right a bit to avoid border-chop [dp]
* Retries weren't discarding DONEBIN packet in host tool [Walter van Niftrik]
* Multi-pass retry in host tool to avoid incorrect data [dp]
* Renamed some conflicting struct members for glibc2.3.x [WvN]

WHATS NEW IN 1.0.3

* actually seems to be working right, unlike 1.0.1 and 1.0.2, which were both
  buggy as hell under many (most?) conditions. If 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 locked up,
  went berzerk, or did other strange and horrible things when you used them,
  try 1.0.3.
* dc-tool should now be able to recover from dropped packets in nearly all
  cases (prior versions would just get stuck if certain packets got dropped)
* gethostinfo syscall now returns the dreamcast's ip, in addition to the ip
  and port of the dc-tool host
* dcload-ip now reports "link change..." on the status line while the rtl8139
  is negotiating. This message should be displayed momentarily when dcload-ip
  starts, when you execute dc-tool -r, or if you disconnect and reconnect the
  ethernet cable. If the message stays there, check your ethernet cable.

WHATS NEW IN 1.0.2

* fixed bug where rx configuration was not restored properly
  (only affected dcload syscalls - could cause dc-tool to segfault apparently,
   and who knows what else...)

WHATS NEW IN 1.0.1

* works with 100mbit now
* added syscall to return the ip and port of the dc-tool host
* added O_BINARY to all open()s in dc-tool to help cygwin users

WHATS NEW IN 1.0.0

* initial release of dcload-ip
